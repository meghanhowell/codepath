A straw rocket uses stem principles with air pressure and force.

Science: how air pressure creates thrust when blown thru a straw. how air resistance and and gravity affect flight.

Technology: designing the rocket body and fins with paper to maximize stability and flight distance.

Enigineering: experimenting with different designs and materials to optimize rocket performance. adjusting size and placement of fins to control trajectory

Math: calculating launch angles and potential flight distances based on design and force
